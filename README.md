A new input system for Unity.

>NOTE: This system is still under active development and not yet stable. To run the project, you will need Unity 2018.3+.

Work-in-progress documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/blob/develop/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem/Documentation~/InputSystem.md).

Issues are expected at this point. However, feel free to report what you find here on GitHub.

## How to Use This In Your Own Project

Please see [Installation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/blob/develop/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem/Documentation~/Installation.md).

The latest version is: `0.1.2-preview`

## Status

Rough assessment of current status:

- Feature Completeness: 80%
- Stability/Robustness: 40%
- Documentation: 10%

## Release Timeline

The planned development timeline for the new input system is as follows:

- *Early November 2018*: Feature cut-off
- *November 2018 - March 2019*: Stabilization & documentation
- *January - March 2019*: Official beta
- *March 2019*: 1.0-preview release together with Unity 2019.1
- *Unity 2019.2*: "Verified" package status (i.e. full part of Unity proper)

Note that the existing input system in Unity (i.e. `UnityEngine.Input`) will be unaffected for now. The new input system is developed in parallel and presents a choice to the user to employ one or the other. Once the new input system has become both fully featured and fully stable, the old input system will likely be put on a path towards deprecation.
